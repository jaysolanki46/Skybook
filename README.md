# Skybook

Skybook software collects call volume information, caller information, and analyzes call
outcomes. Also, Skybook system measures dealer experiences, support efficiency, and many
other call-specific metrics.

Features:

Easy to use: Very easy to use and mostly for new support user, it would be beneficial.

Quality control: Identify frequently reported issues and report them to the rest of our
production team or service departments.

Improved support service &amp; dealer experience: Team can generate the reports on common
issues and provide to dealers to improve efficiency ultimately it would also reduce the burden
for the support team.

Follow-up: Sometimes there is a situation when the user can not resolve the issue during that
support call, so sometimes team says like ”We discuss with team and ring back to you shortly”
but then we forget to ringback to them. Follow-up features would help to do follow up with
that customer with whole information. Also, get a reminder before 5 minutes of follow-up.

Visual Representation: It’ll provide a visual representation of how your Skyzer support is
operating, including the time per call, voicemails, number of outgoing/incoming calls, and
support efficiency.

360-degree analysis: Support user/manager seeing in one screen all the communication done
by all your team members with all the team members of your customer. You come to know
who is talking to whom and when.
